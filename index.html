            <p>Greetings, I'm Marc Hall. I'm 54 years old, and my wife Martha and I reside in a tiny community close to Charlotte, North Carolina. I've always been enamored with plants and their capacity to maintain our health.</p>
            <p>As a result, I have done extensive study on some of the best all-natural practices that can be used by anyone to keep teeth healthy.</p>
            <p>So I developed a blend of fantastic nutrients and plants, including xylitol, collagen, MSM, mint/peppermint, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, vitamins A, C, D3 & K2, that is both straightforward and effective.</p>
